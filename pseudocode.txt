✅ Pseudocode — interrupt + debounce timer
DEFINE button pin
DEFINE debounce time (e.g. 30 ms)

CREATE debounce timer with callback function

FUNCTION debounce callback:
    READ button state
    IF button is pressed:
        REPORT "valid button press"

FUNCTION button interrupt handler:
    STOP debounce timer (if running)
    START debounce timer for debounce time

MAIN PROGRAM:
    CONFIGURE button pin as input with pull-up
    ENABLE interrupt on both edges (press and release)
    REGISTER interrupt handler
    START system (wait forever)

Behaviour in words 

When button changes state:
    Interrupt fires

Interrupt:
    Restart debounce timer

If no more bouncing occurs:
    Timer expires
    Check stable button level
    Confirm press

Even fewer words:

ON button edge:
    delay until stable
    read button
    handle event

Mental model used by embedded engineers

Interrupt = "something changed"
Timer = "wait for noise to settle"
Callback = "decide what actually happened"
